## Project 1: Black Friday Sale Consumer Behaviour Analysis

### Introduction
The "Black Friday Sale Consumer Behaviour Analysis" project aims to analyze consumer behavior during Black Friday sales. The main goal is to understand purchasing patterns and factors influencing consumer decisions.

### Code Explanation
1. **Importing Packages**:
   The necessary libraries for data analysis and visualization are imported, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

2. **Loading Data**:
   The dataset containing consumer purchase data during Black Friday sales is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, converting data types, and removing duplicates.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   Various EDA techniques are applied to understand the data distribution, relationships between variables, and identifying key trends.
   - Histograms and box plots are used to visualize the distribution of numerical features.
   - Bar charts and pie charts are used to analyze categorical variables.

5. **Feature Engineering**:
   New features are created to enhance the predictive power of the dataset. This includes creating interaction terms and polynomial features.

6. **Modeling**:
   Machine learning models are built to predict consumer purchase behavior. Models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests are used.

7. **Evaluation**:
   The models are evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

### Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into consumer behavior during Black Friday sales. Key factors influencing purchases include age, gender, product category, and purchase frequency. The machine learning models demonstrate good predictive performance, providing a foundation for future marketing strategies.
